DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for many channels available in France (Orange, Free,
    cable/ADSL/satellite, Canal+ Sat). The data comes from telestar.fr. The
    default is to grab 7 days, but there are usually 14 days of listings
    available from the current day onwards.

    Grabbing speed varies, but is typically 1-2 minutes/day/channel.

    --configure Choose which bouquets/channels to grab listings data for.

    --list-channels List all available channels.

    --config-file FILE Use FILE as config file instead of the default config
    file. This allows for different config files for different applications.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days (default 7, maximum 14) starting from today.

    --offset N Start grabbing N days from today, rather than starting today.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --debug Provide additional debugging messages during processing.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see <http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/XmltvCapabilities>.

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.
