DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings in XMLTV format for many stations available in
    Turkey. Data is downloaded from Digiturk.

    First you must run tv_grab_tr --configure to choose which stations you
    want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_tr with no arguments will get listings for your
    chosen stations including today.

    --configure Prompt for which stations to download and write the
    configuration file.

    --list-channels Output a list of all channels that data is available
    for. The list is in xmltv-format.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_tr.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N days.

    channel.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    files are stored. All configuration is stored in $HOME/.xmltv/. On
