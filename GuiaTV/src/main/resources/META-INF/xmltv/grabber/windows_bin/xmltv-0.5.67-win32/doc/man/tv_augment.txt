NAME
    tv_augment - Augment XMLTV listings files with automatic and
    user-defined rules.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_augment [--rule <file>] [--config <file>] [--input <file>] [--output
    <file>] [--log <file>] [--nostats] [--debug <level>]

    tv_augment [-r <file>] [-c <file>] [-i <file>] [-o <file>] [-l <file>]
    [-n] [-d <level>]

DESCRIPTION
    Augment an XMLTV xml file by applying corrections ("fixups") to
    programmes matching defined criteria ("rules").

    Two types of rules are actioned: (i) automatic, (ii) user-defined.

    Automatic rules use pre-programmed input and output to modify the input
    programmes. E.g. removing a "title" where it is repeated in a
    "sub-title" (e.g. "Horizon" / "Horizon: Star Wars"), or trying to
    identify and extract series/episode numbers from the programme title,
    sub-title or description.

    User-defined rules use the content of a "rules" file which allows
    programmes matching certain user-defined criteria to be
    corrected/enhanced with the user data supplied (e.g. adding/changing
    categories for all episodes of "Horizon", or fixing misspellings in
    titles, etc.)

    (see "perldoc -F Augment.pm" for more detail)

    --input FILE read from FILE rather than standard input.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --rule FILE file containing the user-defined rules.

    --config FILE configuration file containing a list of which rules you
    want to run.

    --nostats do not print the summary log of actions performed, or list of
    suggested fixups.

    --log FILE output the stats to this FILE (default = augment.log).

    --debug LEVEL print debug info to STDERR (debug level > 3 is not likely
    to be of much use (it generates a lot of output))
